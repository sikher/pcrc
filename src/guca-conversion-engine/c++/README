This is a C++ port of the C# Gurmukhi Unicode Conversion Engine class
that is available at http://guca.sourceforge.net/.  

This port is merely designed for third parties to use natively without
the .NET framework within their own applications.  It is released
under the GNU General Public Licence.

When implementing the C++ class, you should note the following 
differences:

	* Due to lack of support for properties in C++, all the properties
	  are now methods with the prefix "set_" and "get_".
	  
	  For example:
	  
		if (Unicode4 == true)
			....;
		
	  becomes:
	  
		if (get_Unicode4() == true)
			....;
		
	  And:
	  
		Unicode4 = false;
	  
	  becomes:
	  
		set_Unicode4(false);

	* Unlike C# char types, C++ char types are usually 8 bit ASCII and do
	  not natively use Unicode (unless UTF-8 is implemented).  Therefore
	  the C++ port uses wchar_t data types and std::wstring.
	  
	  Make sure you either use TCHAR and define _UNICODE or stick to
	  wchar_t.
	  
	* The class is platform independent and does not use any system APIs.
	  However, it has been developed on Windows and therefore you should
	  report any portablity issues to sukhuk@users.sourceforge.net.
