	M E T A M O R P H

An extensible tool designed to aid in the conversion of Indic text encodings
and scripts.

---INTRODUCTION--------------------------------------------------------------

Metamorph is based on the Gurmukhi Unicode Conversion Application (GUCA). It
builds on this Gurmukhi-centric base and is now an Indic-centric product.

Metamorph ships with an internal module to convert visual order encoded
Gurmukhi text into Unicode.  It also allows users to add mapping files for
both simple (one-to-one) and complex conversions.

Eventually,  Metamorph will ship with Unicode modules for other Indic scripts
and it will facilitate transliteration using ICU's InterIndic Intermediary
Encoding Format.

---LICENSING------------------------------------------------------------------

Publicly released versions of Metamorph are distributed under the GNU GPL.

Privately released testing versions are not re-distributable and are not
licensed under the GNU GPL.  THIS IS A PRIVATE RELEASE VERSION.

---GETTING STARTED------------------------------------------------------------

To get started extract the archive and place the files in a directory of your
choice.  Then install the required mapping files through the Options dialog!

---SPECIAL NOTES--------------------------------------------------------------

Metamorph supports very archaic and uncommon Gurmukhi characters.  Metamorph 
makes use of Udaat at U+0A51 and Yakash at U+0A75.  These characters are not
currently in the Unicode standard but are expected to enter Unicode 5.1.

Multiple vowel signs may not render correctly on your computer system.
