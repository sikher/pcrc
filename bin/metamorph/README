The Punjabi Computing Resource Centre presents...

	M E T A M O R P H

An extensible tool designed to aid in the conversion of Indic text encodings
and scripts.

Visit http://guca.sourceforge.net/

---INTRODUCTION--------------------------------------------------------------

Metamorph is based on the Gurmukhi Unicode Conversion Application (GUCA). It
builds on this Gurmukhi-centric base and is now an Indic-centric product.

Metamorph ships with an internal module to convert visual order encoded
Gurmukhi text into Unicode.  It also allows users to add mapping files for
all sorts of conversions that do not require complex text analysis.

Eventually,  Metamorph will ship with Unicode modules for other Indic scripts
and it will facilitate transliteration using ICU's InterIndic Intermediary
Encoding Format.

---LICENSING------------------------------------------------------------------

Publicly released versions of Metamorph is distributed under the GNU GPL.

Privately released testing versions are not re-distributable.

---GETTING STARTED------------------------------------------------------------

To get started extract the archive and place the files in a directory of your
choice.  Then install the required mapping files through the Options dialogue!

# Mappings
## 'FROM' Mappings
* From.Gurmukhi.mmf - This is the mapping which is the standard Unicode Gurmukhi without any
modifications, used to convert Gurmukhi to InterIndic.
* From.Archaic.Gurmukhi.mmf - This mapping is used for Gurbani and contains within it extra code
to convert Gurmukhi to InterIndic properly.
* From.AnmolLipi.mmf - This is the mapping used for conversion from AnmolLipi font to Unicode.
* From.DrChatrikWeb.mmf - This is the mapping used for conversion from DrChatrikWeb font to Unicode.
* From.GurbaniAkhar.mmf - This is the mapping used for conversion from the GurbaniAkhar family of
fonts to Unicode.

## 'TO' Mappings
* To.Latin.mmf - This is the mapping which is the standard Unicode Latin without any modifications,
used to convert InterIndic to Latin.
* To.Latin.2.mmf - This is the Hybrid Latin Mapping for Gurbani which includes all modifications to
create an accurate phonetic transliteration, used to convert InterIndic to Latin.
* To.Latin.3.mmf - This is the Hybrid Latin Mapping for Gurbani which includes all modifications to
create an accurate phonetic transliteration, used to convert InterIndic to Latin. This is the most up-to-date transliteration, however it may still be incomplete.

## To Make a Phonetic Transliteration
* From.Archaic.Gurmukhi.mmf - This will help you convert Gurmukhi ASCII to InterIndic.
* To.Latin.3.mmf - This will convert InterIndic to Latin Unicode.
* Once the text is in Latin Unicode, you can use the [ICU Transliteration Application](https://github.com/sikher/icu-transliteration-application) or [ICU API](http://site.icu-project.org/) to convert from Latin to other Unicode scripts
